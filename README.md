# 🧩 Theseus and the Minotaur

## 📜 Overview
**Theseus and the Minotaur** is a logic maze game designed by [Robert Abbott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Abbott_(game_designer)). In this game, you play as [Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus), the legendary king of Athens, trying to escape the Labyrinth without being caught by the dangerous [Minotaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur). Unlike traditional mazes, this one is more challenging: the Minotaur takes **two steps** for every one of Theseus's, so each move requires careful planning!

This unique maze was first introduced in Abbott's book *Mad Mazes* in 1990 and was later published in *Games & Puzzles* magazine.
